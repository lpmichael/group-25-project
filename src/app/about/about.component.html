        I'm Madelyn, a senior at Colorado State University majoring in Computer Science. I have two cats named Simba and Nala. In my free time I enjoy
        playing video games, going hiking, crocheting, and cross stitching. I also enjoy learning new languages, and have studied French, Japanese, and Norwegian.
